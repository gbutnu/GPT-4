OpenAI GPT-4 is a large-scale unsupervised language model which generates human-like text. It was trained on a dataset of 8 million webpages.

GPT-4 is a transformer-based language model with 1.5 billion parameters, trained on a dataset of 8 million webpages. It is the largest language model ever created and is capable of generating human-like text.

GPT-4 can generate text in a variety of genres, including news, stories, poetry, and code. It can also be used to answer questions, complete tasks, and generate summaries.

GPT-4 is available for free to researchers and developers. It can be used to create applications such as chatbots, question-answering systems, and text summarizers.

We hope that GPT-4 will enable new applications and research in natural language processing.
